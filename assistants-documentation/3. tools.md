Tools Beta
Give Assistants access to OpenAI-hosted tools like Code Interpreter and Knowledge Retrieval, or build your own tools using Function calling.

The Assistants API is in beta and we are actively working on adding more functionality. Share your feedback in our Developer Forum!
Code Interpreter
Code Interpreter allows the Assistants API to write and run Python code in a sandboxed execution environment. This tool can process files with diverse data and formatting, and generate files with data and images of graphs. Code Interpreter allows your Assistant to run code iteratively to solve challenging code and math problems. When your Assistant writes code that fails to run, it can iterate on this code by attempting to run different code until the code execution succeeds.

Enabling Code Interpreter
Pass the code_interpreterin the tools parameter of the Assistant object to enable Code Interpreter:

node.js

node.js
const assistant = await openai.beta.assistants.create({
  instructions: "You are a personal math tutor. When asked a math question, write and run code to answer the question.",
  model: "gpt-4-1106-preview",
  tools: [{"type": "code_interpreter"}]
});
The model then decides when to invoke Code Interpreter in a Run based on the nature of the user request. This behavior can be promoted by prompting in the Assistant's instructions (e.g., “write code to solve this problem”).

Passing files to Code Interpreter
Code Interpreter can parse data from files. This is useful when you want to provide a large volume of data to the Assistant or allow your users to upload their own files for analysis.

Files that are passed at the Assistant level are accessible by all Runs with this Assistant:

node.js

node.js
// Upload a file with an "assistants" purpose
const file = await openai.files.create({
  file: fs.createReadStream("mydata.csv"),
  purpose: "assistants",
});

// Create an assistant using the file ID
const assistant = await openai.beta.assistants.create({
  instructions: "You are a personal math tutor. When asked a math question, write and run code to answer the question.",
  model: "gpt-4-1106-preview",
  tools: [{"type": "code_interpreter"}],
  file_ids: [file.id]
});
Files can also be passed at the Thread level. These files are only accessible in the specific Thread. Upload the File using the File upload endpoint and then pass the File ID as part of the Message creation request:

node.js

node.js
const thread = await openai.beta.threads.create({
  messages: [
    {
      "role": "user",
      "content": "I need to solve the equation `3x + 11 = 14`. Can you help me?",
      "file_ids": [file.id]
    }
  ]
});
Files have a maximum size of 512 MB. Code Interpreter supports a variety of file formats including .csv, .pdf, .json and many more. More details on the file extensions (and their corresponding MIME-types) supported can be found in the Supported files section below.

Reading images and files generated by Code Interpreter
Code Interpreter in the API also outputs files, such as generating image diagrams, CSVs, and PDFs. There are two types of files that are generated:

Images
Data files (e.g. a csv file with data generated by the Assistant)
When Code Interpreter generates an image, you can look up and download this file in the file_id field of the Assistant Message response:

{
    "id": "msg_OHGpsFRGFYmz69MM1u8KYCwf",
    "object": "thread.message",
    "created_at": 1698964262,
    "thread_id": "thread_uqorHcTs46BZhYMyPn6Mg5gW",
    "role": "assistant",
    "content": [
    {
      "type": "image_file",
      "image_file": {
        "file_id": "file-WsgZPYWAauPuW4uvcgNUGcb"
      }
    }
  ]
  # ...
}
The file content can then be downloaded by passing the file ID to the Files API:

node.js

node.js
const file = await openai.files.retrieveContent(file.id);
When Code Interpreter references a file path (e.g., ”Download this csv file”), file paths are listed as annotations. You can convert these annotations into links to download the file:

{
  "id": "msg_3jyIh3DgunZSNMCOORflDyih",
  "object": "thread.message",
  "created_at": 1699073585,
  "thread_id": "thread_ZRvNTPOoYVGssUZr3G8cRRzE",
  "role": "assistant",
  "content": [
    {
      "type": "text",
      "text": {
        "value": "The rows of the CSV file have been shuffled and saved to a new CSV file. You can download the shuffled CSV file from the following link:\n\n[Download Shuffled CSV File](sandbox:/mnt/data/shuffled_file.csv)",
        "annotations": [
          {
            "type": "file_path",
            "text": "sandbox:/mnt/data/shuffled_file.csv",
            "start_index": 167,
            "end_index": 202,
            "file_path": {
              "file_id": "file-oSgJAzAnnQkVB3u7yCoE9CBe"
            }
          }
          ...
Input and output logs of Code Interpreter
By listing the steps of a Run that called Code Interpreter, you can inspect the code input and outputs logs of Code Interpreter:

node.js

node.js
const runSteps = await openai.beta.threads.runs.steps.list(
  thread.id,
  run.id
);
{
  "object": "list",
  "data": [
    {
      "id": "step_DQfPq3JPu8hRKW0ctAraWC9s",
      "object": "assistant.run.step",
      "type": "tool_calls",
      "run_id": "run_kme4a442kme4a442",
      "thread_id": "thread_34p0sfdas0823smfv",
      "status": "completed",
      "step_details": {
        "type": "tool_calls",
        "tool_calls": [
          {
            "type": "code",
            "code": {
              "input": "# Calculating 2 + 2\nresult = 2 + 2\nresult",
              "outputs": [
                {
                  "type": "logs",
                  "logs": "4"
                }
                        ...
 }
Knowledge Retrieval
Retrieval augments the Assistant with knowledge from outside its model, such as proprietary product information or documents provided by your users. Once a file is uploaded and passed to the Assistant, OpenAI will automatically chunk your documents, index and store the embeddings, and implement vector search to retrieve relevant content to answer user queries.

Enabling Retrieval
Pass the retrieval in the tools parameter of the Assistant to enable Retrieval:

node.js

node.js
const assistant = await openai.beta.assistants.create({
  instructions: "You are a customer support chatbot. Use your knowledge base to best respond to customer queries.",
  model: "gpt-4-1106-preview",
  tools: [{"type": "retrieval"}]
});
How it works
The model then decides when to retrieve content based on the user Messages. The Assistants API automatically chooses between two retrieval techniques:

it either passes the file content in the prompt for short documents, or
performs a vector search for longer documents
Retrieval currently optimizes for quality by adding all relevant content to the context of model calls. We plan to introduce other retrieval strategies to enable developers to choose a different tradeoff between retrieval quality and model usage cost.

Uploading files for retrieval
Similar to Code Interpreter, files can be passed at the Assistant-level or at the Thread-level

node.js

node.js
// Upload a file with an "assistants" purpose
const file = await openai.files.create({
  file: fs.createReadStream("knowledge.pdf"),
  purpose: "assistants",
});

// Add the file to the assistant
const assistant = await openai.beta.assistants.create({
  instructions: "You are a customer support chatbot. Use your knowledge base to best respond to customer queries.",
  model: "gpt-4-1106-preview",
  tools: [{"type": "retrieval"}],
  file_ids: [file.id]
});
Files can also be added to a Message in a Thread. These files are only accessible within this specific thread. After having uploaded a file, you can pass the ID of this File when creating the Message:

node.js

node.js
const message = await openai.beta.threads.messages.create(
  thread.id,
  {
    role: "user",
    content: "I can't find in the PDF manual how to turn off this device.",
    file_ids: [file.id]
  }
);
Maximum file size is 512MB. Retrieval supports a variety of file formats including .pdf, .md, .docx and many more. More details on the file extensions (and their corresponding MIME-types) supported can be found in the Supported files section below.

Deleting files
To remove a file from the assistant, you can detach the file from the assistant:

node.js

node.js
const fileDeletionStatus = await openai.beta.assistants.files.del(
  assistant.id,
  file.id
);
Detaching the file from the assistant removes the file from the retrieval index as well.

File citations
When Code Interpreter outputs file paths in a Message, you can convert them to corresponding file downloads using the annotations field. See the Annotations section for an example of how to do this.

    "object": "thread.message",
    "created_at": 1699073585,
    "thread_id": "thread_ZRvNTPOoYVGssUZr3G8cRRzE",
    "role": "assistant",
    "content": [
      {
        "type": "text",
        "text": {
          "value": "The rows of the CSV file have been shuffled and saved to a new CSV file. You can download the shuffled CSV file from the following link:\n\n[Download Shuffled CSV File](sandbox:/mnt/data/shuffled_file.csv)",
          "annotations": [
            {
              "type": "file_path",
              "text": "sandbox:/mnt/data/shuffled_file.csv",
              "start_index": 167,
              "end_index": 202,
              "file_path": {
                "file_id": "file-oSgJAzAnnQkVB3u7yCoE9CBe"
              }
            }
          ]
        }
      }
    ],
    "file_ids": [
      "file-oSgJAzAnnQkVB3u7yCoE9CBe"
    ],
        ...
  },
Function calling
Similar to the Chat Completions API, the Assistants API supports function calling. Function calling allows you to describe functions to the Assistants and have it intelligently return the functions that need to be called along with their arguments. The Assistants API will pause execution during a Run when it invokes functions, and you can supply the results of the function call back to continue the Run execution.

Defining functions
First, define your functions when creating an Assistant:

node.js

node.js
const assistant = await openai.beta.assistants.create({
  instructions: "You are a weather bot. Use the provided functions to answer questions.",
  model: "gpt-4-1106-preview",
  tools: [{
    "type": "function",
    "function": {
      "name": "getCurrentWeather",
      "description": "Get the weather in location",
      "parameters": {
        "type": "object",
        "properties": {
          "location": {"type": "string", "description": "The city and state e.g. San Francisco, CA"},
          "unit": {"type": "string", "enum": ["c", "f"]}
        },
        "required": ["location"]
      }
    }
  }, {
    "type": "function",
    "function": {
      "name": "getNickname",
      "description": "Get the nickname of a city",
      "parameters": {
        "type": "object",
        "properties": {
          "location": {"type": "string", "description": "The city and state e.g. San Francisco, CA"},
        },
        "required": ["location"]
      }
    }
  }]
});
Reading the functions called by the Assistant
When you initiate a Run with a user Message that triggers the function, the Run will enter a requires_action status. The model can provide multiple functions to call at once via the parallel function calling feature:

{
  "id": "run_3HV7rrQsagiqZmYynKwEdcxS",
  "object": "thread.run",
  "assistant_id": "asst_rEEOF3OGMan2ChvEALwTQakP",
  "thread_id": "thread_dXgWKGf8Cb7md8p0wKiMDGKc",
  "status": "requires_action",
  "required_action": {
    "type": "submit_tool_outputs",
    "submit_tool_outputs": {
      "tool_calls": [
        {
          "tool_call_id": "call_Vt5AqcWr8QsRTNGv4cDIpsmA",
          "type": "function",
          "function": {
            "name": "getCurrentWeather",
            "arguments": "{\"location\":\"San Francisco\"}"
          }
        },
        {
          "tool_call_id": "call_45y0df8230430n34f8saa",
          "type": "function",
          "function": {
            "name": "getNickname",
            "arguments": "{\"location\":\"Los Angeles\"}"
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  },
...
Submitting functions outputs
You can then complete the Run by submitting the output from the function(s) you call. Pass the tool_call_id referenced in the required_action object above to match output to each function call.

node.js

node.js
const run = await openai.beta.threads.runs.submitToolOutputs(
  thread.id,
  run.id,
  {
    tool_outputs: [
      {
        tool_call_id: callIds[0],
        output: "22C",
      },
      {
        tool_call_id: callIds[1],
        output: "LA",
      },
    ],
  }
);
After submitting outputs, the run will enter the queued state before it continues it’s execution.
